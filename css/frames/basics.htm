        <h1>The path </h1>
        <p>Introduced in 2008's Iron Man, the crown jewel of the MCU is undeniably
            Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, whose greatest creation is his extensive 
            gallery of advanced armored suits. From the clunky Mark I and the sleek 
            Mark VII to the nanotechnology of Iron Man's Mark 85, Stark's collection  
            of Iron Man armor continues to be a symbol of heroism. Indeed, Iron Man's 
            suits reflect Stark's own MCU journey â€” receiving upgrades, specializations,
            altered designs, new equipment, and even futuristic materials. The Iron Man 
            suits prove Stark's relentless dedication to improving and refining not just  
            his tech but also his perspective as an Avenger throughout his MCU career.
